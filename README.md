## Comparison
### What is Hortonworks Data Platform?
**Hortonworks Data Platform** (HDP) is an open source Hadoop distrubution that uses the YARN operating system and HDFS to manage on-premises data. It contains a variety of Apache processing engines to process data such as Hive, Tez, Storm, and Spark. 


### What is Azure HDInsight?
**Azure HDInsight** is an open source Hadoop service that is built on HDP that offers data clusters optimized for the Cloud. Since it is backed by HDP, it contains much of the same functionality with some key differences. 

### On-Premises vs. Cloud Data
The primary difference between HDInsight and HDP resides in the way they store data. An organization with an **on-premises** data service stores data internally onsite. A **cloud** data service stores its data externally on public data servers. HDP is an on-premises service, while HDInsight is a cloud service.

### Summary of Differences
 | HDInsight | HDP
--- | --- | ---
Setup | Simple-- no download required | Complex-- download required
Operating Systems | Any | Linux
Data Storage | Cloud | On-premises
File Storage | Azure Storage Blobs | HDP File Store
Entry Cost for Large Clusters | Lower | Higher
